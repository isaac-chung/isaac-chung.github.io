### Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Isaac.
Iâ€™m a Machine Learing Engineer. I work remotely in EMEA, currently based in Tallinn, Estonia.

I'm currently obsessed about turning research into scalable AI products using Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and Go. My background in Aerospace Engineering and Machine Learning research. On a normal day, you'll likely find me sipping coffee or training for my next triathlon.
