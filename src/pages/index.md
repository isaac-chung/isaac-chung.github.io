## Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Isaac.
Iâ€™m a Machine Learning Engineer. I work remotely in EMEA, currently based in Tallinn, Estonia.

I'm currently leading applied research efforts for our EMEA team to scale AI for production loads on a Generative AI platform. My team has been solving search/ranking, retrieval and multi-modal problems. Previously, I was leading the effort in developing custom ML solutions for enterprise customers for visual search and multi-modal use cases. Our stack includes Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and Go. My background in Aerospace Engineering and Machine Learning research. On a normal day, you'll likely find me sipping coffee or training for my next triathlon.
