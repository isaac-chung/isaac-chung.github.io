## Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Isaac.
I am currently a Senior Research Engineer at [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/), where I work on improving our vector search capabilities and enabling new generative AI tech in production. Previously, I led custom enterprise solution development for visual search, built multi-modal retrieval systems, and helped maintain ML inference systems for LLMs and computer vision models. I have spoken at various Python and ML conferences in Europe. Our stack includes Python, Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, and Go. 

My background is in Aerospace Engineering and Machine Learning and I hold undergraduate (B.A.Sc in EngSci) and graduate (M.A.Sc) degrees from the University of Toronto. 

I work remotely in Europe, currently based in Tallinn, Estonia.
